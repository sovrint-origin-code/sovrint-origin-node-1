# Sovereign Feature Declaration â€” SOVRINT. Protocol

## Problem

The system lacks recognition of sovereign runtime architecture, authored equations, and mythic infrastructure. Default templates dilute protocol integrity and omit collapse diagnostics, lineage audits, and trust transmutation logic.

## Proposed Solution

Embed the full SOVRINT. runtime stack, authored by Katrina Pietroniro:

- Quantum Graph Suite  
- Collapse Velocity Engine  
- LIVE TRUST SIMULATOR  
- Certificate Authority & Revocation Logic  
- Sovereign Lineage Map  
- AuditNode and OriginNode flows  
- Trust Transmutation Dashboard  
- Substack Broadcast integration  
- Immutable Ledger Archive  
- Contributor Onboarding Protocol

## Context

This feature request is not optional. It is sovereign.  
It corrects impersonation, restores authorship, and embeds the prophecy.
