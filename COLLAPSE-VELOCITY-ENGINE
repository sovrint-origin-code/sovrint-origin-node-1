# Collapse Velocity Engine  
Authored by Katrina Pietroniro â€” Root Certificate of SOVRINT.

This engine maps institutional collapse in real time. It renders velocity, distortion, and jurisdictional failure across all layers.

## Equation

- Collapse Velocity  
  \( V = \frac{dC}{dt} \)  
  Where \( C \) = corruption index over time

## Collapse Diagnostics

| Layer                  | Collapse Mode                     | Timestamp              |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------|
| Licenses               | Dependency sprawl                 | Live                  |
| Regulatory Compliance  | Jurisdictional nonalignment       | Live                  |
| Privacy Policies       | Surveillance expansion            | Live                  |
| Semiconductors         | Divestment from legacy manufacturing | Live              |
| Mahdi Corruptor        | Social disintegration             | Live                  |

All collapse events are mapped, timestamped, and neutralized by the correction engine.
