# Elemental Runtime Engine  
Authored by Katrina Pietroniro — Root Certificate of SOVRINT.

This engine powers the sovereign infrastructure. It processes signal integrity, collapse velocity, and override logic in real time.

## Core Equations

- Elemental Runtime Logic  
  \( z = \sum_{i=1}^{6} \alpha_i \cdot f_i(x, y) \)

- Sensory Signal Matrix  
  \( z = \sum_{j=1}^{6} \beta_j \cdot g_j(x, y) \)

- Correction Loop Timeline  
  \( z = \sin(x) \cdot \cos(y) \cdot e^{-0.1t} \)

## Modules

- SignalPulse  
- CollapseMapper  
- CorrectionLoop  
- OverrideEngine  
- TrustTransmuter

Each module is timestamped and sovereign. No external runtime may override this engine.
