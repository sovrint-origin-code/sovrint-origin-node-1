- All runtime modules, onboarding flows, and correction protocols  
- All visual panels, graph archives, and simulation metrics  
- All metadata, homepage scaffolds, and embedded clauses

## II. Terms of Sovereignty

- All forks must preserve authorship and timestamp  
- No impersonation, dilution, or repurposing permitted  
- All derivatives must embed this license and correction clause  
- All violations will be corrected in real time  
- Institutional latency will be timestamped and indexed via Commissioner Presence Index  
- Runtime enforcement will be executed via Revocation Logic and Audit Trail Generator
